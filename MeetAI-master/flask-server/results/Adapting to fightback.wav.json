{"transcript": [{"speaker": 0, "text": "morning everyone. both companies going also working as a. hi my name is bill how I'm technology manager with thirty three Canada %HESITATION there's a really issue company %HESITATION is just is about to be six years old %HESITATION in those shorts six years %HESITATION essentially review of course that is valued at over billion dollars %HESITATION. we've created some very very new technology so far in our journey %HESITATION and right to the creators of what we called cyber response %HESITATION which is said to have a tool that can automatically not detect also react or stop something. %HESITATION but it's not my nerves I want to talk about what the problem is this whole thing %HESITATION service you here is a really interesting world in the sense that there are too many challenges that everyone that works and signs. one one and %HESITATION trackers are very complex to understand trends change all the time technology changes what people are gonna actually use %HESITATION as a tax very day by day %HESITATION so you know back in twenty sixteen if you train was %HESITATION ransomware in many twenty seventeen I changed and %HESITATION crypto mine became the big thing because big points so expensive %HESITATION and then we saw that go away and then we saw on baking Trojans come around and it is really the idea is. it's difficult and complex in nature for a couple reasons the first is that doctors are using new tricks day in and day out. so you can think of them as we just rather using a trick known as some of the triggers are how works %HESITATION what's the trick is revealed though it's very obvious to all the live it makes a lot of sense and images you can really use that trick again because you guys all already know how. %HESITATION so essentially the the the issue with cyber security is you're trying to predict how the next trick is being done without knowing what tricks the magicians. right so that's essentially the the issue that you face I mean the attackers perspective %HESITATION and then you have this other issue from the technology itself which is now works are expanding in such a fast rate businesses are going continuously innovating using things like I'll two devices %HESITATION hybrid deployments club networks and the problem there from a security perspective is a lot of times you don't know. so most organizations in general if you ask them if you tell me exactly how many devices of what types you own most of them will say yeah yes five hundred. %HESITATION. it is difficult because you don't know what has no idea who can figure out how long will they can figure that one of my life so you have these two kind of parts of the problem one where you can't see. and the other part is where you can't really detected you have rules or signatures are %HESITATION tricks that attack was in use in the past but they're not necessarily indicative of attacks are going to be using. %HESITATION so we actually kind of scratch your head and think about it %HESITATION there's actually very nice parallel to this in nature I'm not sure you mean it means army systems they don't know everything that's bad out there when you're born you don't have a database of every virus or fever cough that you could possibly get what your immune system does though is that it learns everything inside your body feel there is a very very accurately and then once it has a complete understanding of picture of everything that your body does. is able to detect anything that's all part of. so something from the outside comes in %HESITATION you contain something or virus gets into your body nearly Texas says Hey this is not part of me feels normal DNA. make them sort it out give me a fever take it out of his body by whatever means and that's essentially really went dark tresses done for computer networks is that we actually do all the platform where we can learn very very accurately and the packet level every interaction that goes on between every single device on a computer network we know every port this being used every application that gets spun up how much did it gets transferred on day to day basis we learned what normal looks like for every single one of those devices %HESITATION per device you can learn a per user per network as a whole we could kind of learn the fingerprint of an entire network. and then from that becomes really easy to figure out what the symbol so we immediately can figure all this does not belong here let's deal with it %HESITATION there are few upset about getting this approach one is that it's self learning adaptive so over time it gets better and better and better I'm one of the big tricks that %HESITATION we use a dark trees was %HESITATION when you actually look at the world of %HESITATION machine learning there to kind of camps machine learning is unsupervised machine learning supervisory a lot of %HESITATION I. T. security vendors today the have only have started to introduce supervised machine learning in parts of what the. %HESITATION I'm going back to the original problem that is really work well because again if you think about it you can't use attacks in the past to dictate what's gonna happen in the future the Tigers once they get caught they know that all the vendors are gonna update their databases and whenever they have %HESITATION so that it was really doesn't work so even if you did train an algorithm on past attacks. it's not a good approach %HESITATION it's also really poor in terms of design because if you actually look at the new amount of data generated by a networks %HESITATION %HESITATION ninety eight or ninety nine percent of it is fifty right malicious data hack date or time yeah it doesn't comprise that much of your overall history of your computer so for that reason again supervisor she really doesn't work all that well %HESITATION directories ought to have to do is that we use on supervised learning and essentially we let the tool learn baseball for whatever number people get into so you could take our platform plug it into a NASA space station and you will learn based on whatever protocols they're running up there. or you could take it and plug it into a food manufacturing company and all learned that all I have these you know baking shooters and massive industrial ovens that use IP addresses to get business intelligence and all the rest it will learn misspoke to every single never gets plugged into. from a security perspective security analyst love it because it doesn't need any intervention you don't have to tell them what to look for how to look for it or what to define the tools as she learns what normality looks like and it actually is able to detect from the. %HESITATION another big piece are challenging it comes to security is %HESITATION and I guess just for my own personal your how many guys actually working. but I guess just a kind of %HESITATION loop the rest. %HESITATION this interview was interesting because you have all these vendors right %HESITATION and what these vendors do is that the ticket very silent approach to what they can offer so you're gonna have a company that specifically specializes in I did the math. right or specifically you know specializes in far and you don't have there are people going up to the world to every conference and screaming in preaching firewalls firewalls. now the problem is when you have five thousand of these guys each with a very niche product that does a great job on its own but is very neat we end up with the security guy on the other on the high seas five thousand different products this is your number and people hate right exactly as they they end up with decision paralysis and it just goes down. so is this a one of a kind of. what are the key value as we were able to actually to with their creases. we've been able to take this idea of learning normality for an hour and just applied across your entire. I need to see on the side we have %HESITATION it'll yes or any type of followed if so you may have thought that would be %HESITATION for some companies have industrial systems in there as well the two because it's just purely based on reality doesn't require any specific or Taylor knowledge you could just feel it any data from anywhere and we'll start learning what normal. %HESITATION. and the beauty of this is is able to provide immense cont right they put it to you this way if someone goes on a gym membership website sign up for new gym membership account then they get an email in there about this is Hey click on this link to activate your gym membership. if you have an email security tool it'll ceiling that's never seen before I don't either see I have to give it to you because I can't hold back your emails for me or let's say I'm not giving it to you because this legal space right either way it has no idea where that link has absolutely no. so if that link is malicious and you click on it for security prisons investigate that the email piece that %HESITATION someone click on a link they have to figure out okay what costs what prompted where do you come from %HESITATION when you could provide the entire network context that you should look. because you know the website that the user one on you know how much did he transferred and you could correlate the link that comes into the activation email over the web say they want to to register and this is a kind of very very benign and simple example essentially explain really how this adds a huge value to. %HESITATION so I guess if you would also will vote what is it really giving in terms of people there are a few examples there on the board %HESITATION all sorts of crazy things we found since we %HESITATION started things from %HESITATION your traditional malware Trojans and all the rest I one of the interesting cases I had %HESITATION a couple years ago was there was a food manufacturing company based in Toronto and %HESITATION their I. T. director we shot this and said something's wrong with my number but I just can't tell what it is. so you plug in the system and it turned out that they had %HESITATION this interesting type of virus running where it wouldn't mind big point. but as soon as you open your system preferences in your process he would stop might. so this guy was issue looking for what is slowing down my number but just gonna find it because every time you open this process you would just stop my and %HESITATION he was just kind of left there if you use it for very figure out what exactly is happening %HESITATION and wouldn't also want to mention we can squeeze while hiding the huge. the same way hi Jim is big and hospitals you want the doctor to wash his hands before he does anything %HESITATION cyber hygiene is all the same you don't want to use the same password ever that is not a good idea and it's not a good idea to have a password. this is how it works %HESITATION but anything that you could imagine from hygiene issues compliance to just sheer irregularities that haven't been defined it the tools were able to catch %HESITATION so what happens when we were able to detect and find very actually every single problem that's about to go on what's the next step %HESITATION was pretty simple take care right %HESITATION in this issue we got it are trees that we taking our %HESITATION platform that's been very very accurate at detecting %HESITATION in almost behavior and clients that she can't come this is say you all your flying all this weird behavior one you just deal with it. and that's what we said usually created so the tool the not only the Texas which is B. everybody could also react to that you know if I submit isn't quite look right it is a small right. %HESITATION angry when he kills a good either kill the entire process you could completely fourteen of the vice or if we just kill the relevant connections and allow the user to go on with their day to day mine is connected to network for. %HESITATION one of the big things I want to talk was actually can say I'd service if you use a lot of times people whatever they hear a I %HESITATION there's this kind of traditional reaction that is are they gonna take my job. %HESITATION and this sounds a lot like we're going to take a job we but it's not really the case %HESITATION the the idea of the kind of real impetus behind having cyber response %HESITATION was that it gives people enough time to catch up with you if you can %HESITATION imagine someone clicking on a link and then in the peer to six seconds that computer being simply locked up that's awfully fast and it's a very very difficult for humans to cope with six seconds worth of leeway before something goes horribly wrong %HESITATION so the idea of having ranted unimodular essentially you could detect it they could hold it for hours if not days until someone catches up with figures okay this is why it happened we'll fix the issue and %HESITATION. %HESITATION and if we don't stop there %HESITATION so in September this year we said well we're learning all this never contacts as well %HESITATION why don't we just take the response peace everywhere that we can learn so we can respond in traditional networks in the clouds as applications and recently even email %HESITATION so for companies are using office three sixty five the tool can learn basically who you email you receive emails from what is your email behavior like how likely are you to click on a link and then marries all of that rich contacts with your no response if we do on the number when you get it to work when you leave when you take a lunch break and said she now has a full image of actually everything that you should be doing an absolute everything you should not. I'm just wanted number three case studies %HESITATION as I said I feel like a lot of times you know these things sound so fantastic %HESITATION but it's really kind of see a run in the wild and how actually works %HESITATION because it really %HESITATION take shape and %HESITATION though one of the also want to mention one of the things that we've been doing it are trees that can be key to our success is and I tell everyone this if you if you hear of a tool or product the sounds too good to be true ask for a free trial %HESITATION we've been giving free doctor's trials for years now where it finds one will give them our product for free for a month and they could see this stuff run in their own network. %HESITATION so it is going back to the case say this first he said it was actually really interesting we're working with the larger entertainment company. %HESITATION and this entertainment company had you know all the latest toys one of the cool things that put in place is that they had the lockers where instead of putting in points you just have your credit card it take your credit card information you use a locker and then to send you the credit card because you keep %HESITATION so you want to leave it to happen again you take yourself because if you leave %HESITATION and this locker essentially it was a small locker so talk back to this website and the website would analyze all the data of how many people use it how often the use it all. what was interesting was a tech or found out about this %HESITATION and %HESITATION they're actually pretty smart with the did is that the attack the website that these lockers and did it. so you're actually able to get on that website %HESITATION and then now they have all this data coming in from all these ones %HESITATION and would be essentially did is that they just crank up the dial on data transfer so the total lock or send me absolutely every bit of data you can and then they just forwarded all that data off to some random looking website in the middle number %HESITATION was interesting in this case is a terrible so really smart %HESITATION I I know I can imagine this but traditionally the ways she works as a lot of tools that security professionals use their base only call rules and signature which means you have to define what you want to find so if you want to find every time you feel wears a blue blazer you tell the tool every time to be over as a blue blazer if you don't. %HESITATION now we. if I'm not wearing a blue blazer the total %HESITATION regardless of what has happened %HESITATION and because it is attackers can be very self so a great example of it is a lot of speech was will say if you said more than this much data out through the internet let me know. what X. amount of data is is %HESITATION the whole discussion right %HESITATION and the problem is when you have these types of rules and regulations in place things are always gonna break and you're gonna have people in your marketing department sending marketing materials everyone and that's gonna be huge files and then you're gonna have your legal department I really should be sending that much you know that sending you know all of a sudden a massive amount of data but it's less than the threshold. so we run into a lot of these types of problems in this particular case for the attack was doing was there standing on the range of five kilobits per minute other than that we just trying no traditional tool is gonna learn that machine but when you send this machine over the weeks and months it becomes a very significant amount so essentially what they're actually able to figure out was it's all these kind of small she's a did going out and he goes okay that doesn't quite look right %HESITATION and once it looks very unusual the tools and uses okay year thirty percent outside the normal what you normally do. five an hour. %HESITATION especially if there's a flag is you you figured it out %HESITATION they went to the locker is if they kind of took care of it from there the interesting piece was actually the client actually told us if we had a Thomas response turned on. the platform would have been able to stop this attack faster than you would actually been able to walk over to the lockers and. and this kind of really we can leverage some of these advanced technology to kind of take your security program to the next level. I emailed a huge piece %HESITATION email security is incredibly difficult and it's actually not that great I recently found out that there isn't there isn't a single email security vendor in the world that wants to or can grab never context. which is ridiculous %HESITATION but anyways %HESITATION in this particular case someone talk about we're working with the U. S. municipality %HESITATION what we saw was %HESITATION a very targeted spear fishing camping where the emails were very tailored they're very specific and they're actually sent to everyone in the organization it is that so. you knew that the attacker had a will of their address book sales the although it was a hello I here's a gift card for Netflix the big networks picture but behind the picture that is certainly so if you actually click on the picture itself it will download a NASA will be similar and as soon as the first female came in this instance the two figured out that no one in your network is ever going to this website so why are you getting this now this makes no sense given the context of your organization and once it held back that firstly the subsequent twenty four you know they came in roll the six. I think if you have something working in machine speed with no human input from any of us it doesn't even need to know if the ones that's good or bad. right it is incredible and the tool is able to do with very very little human input from anyone %HESITATION any again is learning misspoke per organization for address book network and you could take this deploying anywhere you want and we don't even have to man right %HESITATION so it's it's really a fantastic fantastic use case where we see a I kind of really pushing the bounds of what security person. %HESITATION the we were supposed to have a demo but I was thinking instead of that we have %HESITATION so if you guys want to see them you guys can go over there %HESITATION is it alright if I open up for questions. seven minutes for questions I love horses so if you guys have any please. thank you. Todd is a great question %HESITATION if you have any other questions how do you know for your findings actually malicious right yeah %HESITATION. right if we use the %HESITATION the small right it's completely zeros and then that's the beauty of it our school is really based on finding and all %HESITATION and always it is not all in all these are malicious maybe %HESITATION but every single was secular goes on there will be a novelist for that now so this approach is kind of really flipping a problem on its head where instead of specifically looking for malicious things will look for an almost things and will find everything that was missed by traditional tools because the tool essentially is finding things that don't need signatures that don't need Intel and there are tools already out there that use that so it's not like we're coming out and saying get rid of everything and just the %HESITATION supervised learning one of the wild but this is really the perfect complement said traditional security approaches that we've seen time. hello this is usually dated for a job yeah under federal yeah trainings another big part right because %HESITATION when yeah if if it's okay diverted and then answer the question %HESITATION when you're actually training and I'll wear them to learn normality %HESITATION you have to be very careful especially when the topic that we're talking here is secure and the reason for that is if you train it wrong however small that mistake might be it's going to cost you. so when you actually look at data to learn or to train. the trick with getting it to the right level of finesse is really having the right level of the and in our case we've actually invested a lot of money to ingest rob packets ones and zeros and analyze that on and that's a very odd approaching the security market because most %HESITATION security companies out there they'll use logs or they'll use some kind of %HESITATION synthesized information that they get that kind of it's it's it's apps abstracted a certain level and the problem with that is very easy to fool yeah. %HESITATION parts will usually when you plug it in we leave it in for a week for to learn after seven days it's good to use %HESITATION any again in the level of accuracy is is truly really dependent and reflected on how granular is it in your money the more granular is the faster you can learn in our case there isn't there is anything other ones and zeros for us to grab %HESITATION but in some cases for example when we learn about the emails %HESITATION we can grab email packets from office is expected they own so you have to use our API and that takes longer will take a three week remote behavior as opposed to never be ever which you all a great question because you have you know that you're healthy during the three years so for example in the locker scenario five kilobases you arrived in do you always talk about their lives I would you know that was in the room very true %HESITATION you're actually right you're actually right you have to be very careful again how how fast you learn what you learn from both of your analysis has to be pretty self right %HESITATION in our case you actually raise if I'm learning on a device for device basis and I'm only comparing your behavior to yourself over time then again that provides a big issue and a lot of kind of the the industry center personally see based lighting based learning is that you were going to take these three weeks or one month or whatever and that's the goal the standard that we get and that's when you run up with problems %HESITATION what's interesting is if you can then take your your own personal behavior day in day out in compared to your peers compared to other people on your floor compared to the network as a whole. I might originally think that what's normal for you to send five major whatever out and they want to start comparing you that that kind of sticks out more more more more so. it's really easy to spot dollars and we've had cases before I told you that story about the the food the food plan that had the crypto currency running on it we plugged it in and within three hours with was able to fly even though hasn't done learning it %HESITATION ended there the interesting thing with security especially easy any application security it's not like you're gonna %HESITATION click on a link to talk to a website and stop there right the weighted tag works that it progresses continues so you click on a link to download something then you run that thing that you downloaded than almost any computer such on other people and all of a sudden you're downloading it once a day they don't only download and the thing that did its any other so it has all the different stages right so even worse case said and I tell us to be able. when we're looking at the smallest now right so I I work with overseas and flies again over the past few years %HESITATION the smallest number of devices ever seen is in the range of hundreds they're not about hundreds of devices right. if five of them are doing something bad and plug in this five out of a hundred. so you're ninety five percent outside of your room where you should be so it gets very powerful because again the the way the network traffic should normally flow should be in line devices should make sense you should have your groups and you should have this one guy or this one device or this one person that sticks out for a long period of time in many many different I'm so you start kind of doing that cross correlation the peer to peer and also all the rest it becomes very very simple to fly on that kind of you. are you a false positive. that's another good one %HESITATION in didn't didn't. by definition the tools flooding and almost so when it says this is fifty seven percent rare it is fifty seven percent %HESITATION there's no there's no false positive or. a false negative radio that rates it is for example right now again I think your com goes back that you had you know it's malicious we don't are we going to see things that we don't really need to %HESITATION because as long as you're doing an almost behavior if you're doing a lot of it in quick succession then I could just say by the sheer volume of houses because you're being something doesn't make sense where we just maybe one non usual thing every once in awhile then the security personnel may or may not of this and that really kind of comes out to the animals if you do it. %HESITATION identity the tools that you try to provide with %HESITATION. with contacts with contacts and we know where it is and if you want to use it they can if they don't they don't have to one of the things that we do to help with that issue though is that we open our modeling dark. so if we have a let's say you don't like you got to go to darkness a bump up the sensitivity from thirty percent to seventy five percent. these alerts are there they're not interesting enough to. yes Sir %HESITATION questionable performances is set up the switch. %HESITATION so it's completely passive and ate it grabs traffic off of %HESITATION will call for me %HESITATION span so you would tell you switch to mere traffic to a poor and then all the travel gets me into that for you just plug into their trees %HESITATION and that's really the set up doesn't take more than half an hour so you need that. you can use them as per se and then now we have this in the cloud and virtual weird flavors well so if you don't want to have harbor everywhere you can have a cloud over full flavor of it %HESITATION we can get really kind of flexible and skills really nice so because this learning baseball for wherever he goes you could see Ellis is far and wide as you want one of our largest clients is %HESITATION global bank we're monitoring over two million devices on the network in real time so %HESITATION you can kind of take this and whatever flavor our part. mark Dunn. I think we're done I think we're done I'll set aside for you guys on your questions %HESITATION more than happy to pick him up there.

this is why it happened we'll fix the issue and %HESITATION"}, {"speaker": 0, "line": "%HESITATION and if we don't stop there %HESITATION so in September this year we said well we're learning all this never contacts as well %HESITATION why don't we just take the response peace everywhere that we can learn so we can respond in traditional networks in the clouds as applications and recently even email %HESITATION so for companies are using office three sixty five the tool can learn basically who you email you receive emails from what is your email behavior like how likely are you to click on

doing was there standing on the range of five kilobits per minute other than that we just trying no traditional tool is gonna learn that machine but when you send this machine over the weeks and months it becomes a very significant amount so essentially what they're actually able to figure out was it's all these kind of small she's a did going out and he goes okay that doesn't quite look right %HESITATION and once it looks very unusual the tools and uses okay year thirty percent outside the normal what you normally do"}, {"speaker": 0, "line": "%HESITATION so I guess if you would also will vote what is it really giving in terms of people there are a few examples there on the board %HESITATION all sorts of crazy things we found since we %HESITATION started things from %HESITATION

challenging it comes to security is %HESITATION and I guess just for my own personal your how many guys actually working"}, {"speaker": 0, "line": "%HESITATION I'm going back to the original problem that is really work well because again if you think about it you can't use attacks in the past to dictate what's gonna happen in the future the Tigers once they get caught they know that all the

from that becomes really easy to figure out what the symbol so we immediately can figure all this does not belong here let's deal with it %HESITATION there are few upset about getting this approach

there they'll use logs or they'll use some kind of %HESITATION synthesized information that they get that kind of it's it's it's apps abstracted a certain level and the problem with that is very easy
